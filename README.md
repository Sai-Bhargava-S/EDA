Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA is process of that Involves understanding,Summerzing,Visualizing data to uncover patterns and test the hypothese ,It helps data scientists gain insights into datasets and prepare them for modeling by cleaning, transforming, and understanding the relationships within the data.

Key Points to Remember for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

1. Understand the Data: Analyze dataset structure (rows, columns, types) and summarize it using .info() and .describe(). Handle Missing Data: Identify and manage missing values using imputation or removal techniques.

2.Univariate Analysis: Explore individual variables (distributions, counts) using histograms and bar plots.

3.Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis: Examine relationships between variables with scatter plots, correlation heatmaps, and pair plots.

4.Detect Outliers: Use box plots or z-scores to identify and handle outliers effectively.

5.Feature Insights: Derive meaningful patterns, insights, or transformations (e.g., scaling, encoding) for better data understanding.
